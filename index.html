            <p>This is a web application that takes a user's birthday and calculates the day of the week they were born and
                then depending on their gender outputs their Akan Name.</p>
            <p>Akan names are derived from Ghanian culture. Frequently in Ghana, children are given their first name as a 'day name'
                which corresponds to the day in the week they were born. Here are Ghanian day names.</p>
